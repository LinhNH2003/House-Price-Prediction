## Overview
The objective of this project is to predict house prices using various machine learning techniques. The dataset was collected through web scraping and processed to train and evaluate different models. The focus was on improving model accuracy through tuning hyperparameters and evaluating performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.

## Data Collection
Data was obtained by scraping relevant housing data from online sources. This included features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property details that affect house prices.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps involved:
- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Splitting data into training and test sets

## Models and Algorithms
Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- XGBoost

Each model's hyperparameters were tuned using techniques such as GridSearchCV to enhance performance.

## Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **R-squared** (Coefficient of Determination)

Hyperparameter tuning was performed to achieve optimal results for each model.

## Requirements
The project requires the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## Results
The model achieved significant improvements in predictive accuracy through hyperparameter tuning, with the best-performing model achieving an RMSE of [insert RMSE score] and an R-squared score of [insert R-squared score].
